=== Things to higllight in code
. Open appsettings.json
.. Explain `eureka:client` section when running locally
.. This will be overriden when running on CloudFoundry
. In startup.cs
.. `services.AddDiscoveryClient(Configuration);` to register discovery services
.. `app.UseDiscoveryClient();` to start using them
.. `.AddHttpMessageHandler<DiscoveryHttpMessageHandler>();` when building up HttpClient factory
.. Explain the use of HttpClientFactory (new in ASP.NET Core 2.1). Article explaining why it should be used instead of using HttpClient by hand https://www.stevejgordon.co.uk/introduction-to-httpclientfactory-aspnetcore
